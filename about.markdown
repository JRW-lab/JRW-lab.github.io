Hello! I am Jeremiah Wimer, a graduate student studying statistical signal proccessing, but my friends call me Rhys (my middle name). This website acts as a host for code written for project I've been a part of. In wireless communications, I've specifically conducted work on realistic pulse shaping waveforms, orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS), orthogonal delay-Doppler multiplexing (ODDM) and tri-orthogonal ODDM. I've also trained an accurate elastic-net logistic regression model capable of detecting dehydration in infants, and another for detecting internal bleeding in pigs.
