<p>Hello, I'm Jeremiah Wimer—but my friends call me by my middle name, Rhys. I'm a graduate student in electrical engineering with a specialization in statistical signal processing. I have a strong interest in writing efficient, reliable code and tackling complex system-level challenges, driven by curiosity and a passion for sharing knowledge.</p>

<p>I believe that meaningful progress—both in technology and society—comes from collaboration and open understanding. This website serves as a platform to share my experiences, projects, and insights with the broader community.</p>

<p>Here, you'll find examples of my work in statistical signal processing and wireless communications, along with a selection of personal projects. My experience includes research and development in pulse shaping waveforms, modulation techniques such as OFDM, OTFS, and ODDM, as well as machine learning applications in biomedical signal analysis.</p>
