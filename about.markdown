Hello! I am Jeremiah Wimer, a graduate student studying statistical signal proccessing, but my friends call me Rhys (my middle name). This website showcases some of my professional work with statistical signal processing and wireless communications, as well as some personal projects I've been interested in. Specfically, I have experience working with pulse shaping waveforms, OTFS, ODDM, and machine learning applications in biomedical signal analysis.

This website acts as a host for code written for project I've been a part of. In wireless communications, I've specifically conducted work on realistic pulse shaping waveforms, orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS), orthogonal delay-Doppler multiplexing (ODDM) and tri-orthogonal ODDM. I've also trained an accurate elastic-net logistic regression model capable of detecting dehydration in infants, and another for detecting internal bleeding in pigs.
